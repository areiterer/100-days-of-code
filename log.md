# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
I started with the FreeCodeCamp "Show the Local Weather" project as my first project of this challenge.
At the moment, it just shows sample data. I added some test data from the API and a overall component which shows the 
name of the city and the temperature.
This will be refactored soon, as it is just my starting point.

**Thoughts:** I first tried to do this in CodePen - since it's a FreeCodeCamp project, but I soon decided to work locally 
and storing my progress on GitHub because I may want to extend the app later on and get a folder architecture I am more used to.
