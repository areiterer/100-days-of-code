# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
This day I refactored the WeatherData component to take every single piece of information as a separate prop.
I did this because this way I can make the WeatherData component as pure and predictable as possible.

Also, I put some logic into the root "App" component to retrieve the current geolocation and fetch the current weather 
data from OpenWeatherMap.

**Thoughts:** Today's tasks were pretty straight forward. I still did not spend any time on design or styling - I want at least finish the basic functionality
first, so that I can find the right position for every piece of information I want to show.

As my next steps I plan to 
* add a input field so that users can enter different locations
* display humidity, wind speed, air pressure, etc.
* introduce icons instead of the labels
* add a big icon somewhere to display the current weather

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
I started with the FreeCodeCamp "Show the Local Weather" project as my first project of this challenge.
At the moment, it just shows sample data. I added some test data from the API and a overall component which shows the 
name of the city and the temperature.
This will be refactored soon, as it is just my starting point.

**Thoughts:** I first tried to do this in CodePen - since it's a FreeCodeCamp project, but I soon decided to work locally 
and storing my progress on GitHub because I may want to extend the app later on and get a folder architecture I am more used to.
